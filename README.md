This project was based on this [course:](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/onlinelearning-courses/introduction-to-ai-with-blueprints)

### **About the Project:** 
I used Unreal Engine's AI tools and present to know how AI agents work within a video game environment. 

It covers Navigation, Perception, Behavior Trees, and the Environment Query System (EQS), all using the Blueprint visual scripting system.

The final result is an AI agent that senses the world around them, considers what to do based upon those senses, and navigates the world intelligently in order to reach a specified goal.
